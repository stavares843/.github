# Satellite at a glance: Why/What is Satellite?

Satellite IM offers several advantages that make it a promising platform for secure, private, and decentralized communication. Here are some key reasons why it could be beneficial:

## Enhanced Privacy and Security

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Satellite IM uses end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the intended recipients can read the messages. This protects user data from potential breaches and unauthorized access [source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220607005114/en/Decentralized-Communication-Platform-Satellite-IM-Completes-10.5-Million-Seed-Funding-Led-By-Multicoin-Venture-Fund-Framework-Ventures) [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/).
- **Decentralization**: The platform operates on a decentralized network, meaning that it doesn't rely on central servers that could be targeted for attacks. Instead, data is distributed across a network of nodes, enhancing security and reducing the risk of data breaches [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/).

## User Data Ownership

- **No Data Tracking**: Unlike traditional messaging platforms, Satellite IM does not track or store user data. This approach respects user privacy and eliminates concerns over data being sold or misused by third parties [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/) [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/).
- **Sovereign Storage**: Users have full control over their data, which is stored using the Interplanetary File System (IPFS). This means users retain ownership and control over their files and communications [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/).

## High-Quality Communication

- **4K Video and Lossless Audio**: Satellite IM supports high-definition video and audio communications, providing a superior quality experience for users [source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220607005114/en/Decentralized-Communication-Platform-Satellite-IM-Completes-10.5-Million-Seed-Funding-Led-By-Multicoin-Venture-Fund-Framework-Ventures) [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/).
- **Large File Sharing**: The platform allows users to share files up to 10GB, making it convenient for transferring large documents, media files, and other data without compression or quality loss [source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220607005114/en/Decentralized-Communication-Platform-Satellite-IM-Completes-10.5-Million-Seed-Funding-Led-By-Multicoin-Venture-Fund-Framework-Ventures).

## Flexibility and Customization

- **Open-Source Platform**: Satellite IM's code is open-source, allowing developers to build and customize applications on top of it. This encourages innovation and continuous improvement of the platform by the community [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/) [source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220607005114/en/Decentralized-Communication-Platform-Satellite-IM-Completes-10.5-Million-Seed-Funding-Led-By-Multicoin-Venture-Fund-Framework-Ventures).
- **Developer-Friendly**: The modular framework and compatibility with multiple blockchain networks make it easy for developers to integrate new features and enhance the platform's functionality [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/) [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/).

## Community and Ecosystem

- **Focused on Crypto Communities**: Satellite IM is designed to cater to the needs of crypto communities by offering crypto-native features and a decentralized backend. This focus helps it serve a specific user base more effectively than general-purpose messaging platforms like Discord [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/) [source](https://cryptonews.net/news/blockchain/22562181/).

Overall, Satellite IM's combination of privacy, security, high-quality communication, flexibility, and community focus makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a secure and decentralized messaging platform.
